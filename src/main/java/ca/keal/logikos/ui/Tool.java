 * 
 * There are several hooks that subclasses may override. When the user clicks on the tool, {@link #onSelect()} is run;
 * when they click on another tool, {@link #onDeselect()} is run. When the user, with this tool selected, hovers over a
 * spot on the field, {@link #onHover(double, double, UIComponent)} is called, and when they click using this tool
 * {@link #onClick(double, double, UIComponent)} is called. When their mouse leaves the pane, {@link #onLeavePane()} is
 * called. When the user presses a key with this tool selected, {@link #onKeyPress(int)} is called.
 * 
 * Tools also have a name and a tooltip.
